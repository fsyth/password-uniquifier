    <h3 class="accordion">Why is this a thing?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        It's annoying to come up with a unique password for every website.
        You normally have to store them all in a secure database, or just not bother and use the same password for everything which is a security risk.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion">What does it do?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        This simple program let's you use a single master password to generate unique passwords for anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        It always generates the exact same password for the same inputs, so you don't need to store anything. Just remember the master password.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion">How does it work?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        It takes your master password and the name of a website (or anything really), then passes them
        through a one-way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">Cryptographic Hash Function</a> and maps the result onto a generated password.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion">Is it secure?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is computationally irreversible* and guarantees that your master password or passwords for other websites cannot be obtained if one generated password is compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
        *<span class="small">Provided that your master password is reasonably strong.</span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion">Can I trust you?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        I made this for personal use, but figured others might find it useful too.
      </p>
      <p>
        All steps have been taken to ensure this is secure and safe to use. No sensitive data ever leaves this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will never ask for your username. Without it, any passwords here are worthless.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code is all open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/fsyth/password-uniquifier">GitHub</a> so anyone can check that it doesn't do anything malicious.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion">Why do I need to set a master password?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Passwords are generated using your master password as part of the input to the hashing algorithm. Therefore if you enter a different master password, a different password will be generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you were to typo your master password accidentally, passwords generated using it would be impossible to reproduce later.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve this, the program has you set a master password with an additional 'confirm password' field to prevent typos.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you tick 'remember password', your master password will be securely hashed and stored locally on your computer. This means that the password cannot be retrieved, but anything you enter can be checked to see if it matches. This way you can be warned if you accidentally make a typo without your master password being known.
